# Data Analysis Project - Exploring Global Trends in Life Expectancy and Mortality Rates from Non-Communicable Diseases

### Objective
To analyze and understand the patterns, trends, and relationships between the life expectancy and mortality rates from non-communicable diseases of all countries and regions worldwide across several years. This project aims to highlight global health disparities through understanding the potential associations with a country's rate of mortality from non-communicable diseases and its average life expectancy.

### Background
Life expectancy (commonly measured as *life expectancy at birth*) is a statistical measure of the average lifespan for a specific region for some time. Global life expectancy, which collectively considers individuals from all genders, classes, and locations, has increased throughout human history. This is due to a variety of reasons, including but not limited to advances in public health, reduced rates of infant and child mortality, and higher standards of life. However, major discrepancies and inequalities in the average lifespan are evident when comparing factors such as an individual's access to medical care, economic circumstances, diet, poverty, gender, genetics, and more. 

A non-communicable disease (aka *NCD*) is a disease that is not directly transmissible from one person to another, so is not usually infectious. NCDs are the leading cause of death globally; some NCD examples include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune diseases, strokes, heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, and more. While many NCDs are considered preventable, there are certainly risk factors that increase the chance and prevalence of these diseases, including blood pressure, cholesterol, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, weight, and genetics. Social determinants of health could also be risk factors for NCDs.

So now we have a measure of lifespan and the leading cause of death. What are some observations we can make about these, and what patterns and trends amongst lifespan and non-communicable death mortality rates can we observe?

  44.518 -> 52.91: 18.85%

- **What country had the highest average life expectancy for each year?**
  2000: The highest life expectancy in any part of the world is Gibraltar (81.37). But the country with the highest leb was Japan (81.076).
  
  2010: The highest life expectancy in any part of the world is Gibraltar (81.37). But the country with the highest leb was Japan (81.076).
  
  2015: The highest life expectancy in any part of the world is Hong Kong SAR (84.278). But the country with the highest leb was Japan (83.79).

- **How has the average life expectancy increased or decreased for each country from 1960 to 2019?**

- **What country has the largest change (increase or decrease) in life expectancy from 1960 to 2019?**

- **What is the global trend in average life expectancy from 1960 to 2019?**

- **What is the median life expectancy for each country in 2019, and how does it compare to the mean?**
